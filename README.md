"Mashroomland" is a platform game created in Python using the Pygame package.
The player takes on the role of a hero who, due to a mistake in a space-time portal, lands in a mysterious land called Mashroomland.
The goal of the game is to reach the portal located in the top right corner of the screen, collect as many mushrooms as possible, and avoid enemies.
Almost all of the graphics are created by me using the AI Copilot Designer tool,
an online character generator (https://www.avatarsinpixels.com), Gimp, and Canva.
